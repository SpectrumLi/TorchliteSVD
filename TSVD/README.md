# What is TSVD

TSVD is a thread-safety violation detection tool described in the paper "Efficient and Scalable Thread-Safety Violation Detection --- Finding thousands of concurrency bugs during testing" in SOSP 2019.

## What is thread-safety violation

A thread-safety violation occurs when an application concurrently calls into a library/class in a way that violates its thread-safety contract. For example, in .NET, `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary` is not thread-safe for concurrent accesses when one or both accesses are write operations. Therefore, the following two concurrent operations are not thread-safe.

    //Dictionary dict
    Thread1: dict.Add(key1,value);
    Thread2: dict.ContainsKey(key2);
    
The above two concurrent operations can give nondeterministic results or corrupt the data structure, even if `key1` and `key2` are different.

### What kind of class is not thread-safe

In C#, most classes under the `System.Collections` namespace are thread-unsafe unless they are protected by a specific lock.

## How to apply TSVD

### Overview

`TSVD` is designed for .NET applications. It works by instrumenting application binaries and running existing workloads/tests on instrumented binaries. Instrumentation is done by tool called `TSVDInstrumenter.exe`. Compiling the source code in this repo produces `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` in `src/TSVDInstrumenter/bin/Debug`.

As mentioned, applying `TSVD` on an application involves two steps:  

+ Instrument the testing binaries with `TSVDInstrumenter.exe`. The usage of `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` is:

    `.\TSVDInstrumenter.exe [directory containing applicaiton binaries] [path to instrumentation configuration] [path to runtime configuration]`

	The instrumentation configuration file dictates `TSVD`'s instrumentation behavior (e.g., what thread-unsafe APIs are instrumented), while the runtime configuration file contains `TSVD`'s runtime behavior (e.g., what algorithm to use, where to write bug log files, etc.) 

+ Run instrumented binaries with existing workloads/tests. If any thread-safety violation is detected, `TSVD` will produce a file named `TSVD-bug-*.tsvdlog` that contains details of the violation.

### Example

The repo contains an example application `TestApps/DataRace` that includes several thread-safety violations (concurrently sorting the same `List`). `TSVD` can be applied on `DataRace.exe` as follows:

+ Instrumentation. Under DataRace/bin/Debug, run the following command in command line:

    `& ..\..\..\..\src\TSVDInstrumenter\bin\Debug\TSVDInstrumenter.exe . .\Configurations\instrumentation-config.cfg .\Configurations\runtime-config.cfg`. It instruments all the binaries (in this case, only `DataRace.exe`) in the current folder. It will also copy `TSVD` runtime library and runtime configuration file to the current folder.

+ Run. After observing the `Instrumentation result: OK` which indicates `DataRace.exe` is already instrumented, run `.\DataRace.exe`. Since running the insturmented `DataRace.exe`, it writes all the detected thread-safety violation to the `TSVD-bug-*.tsvdlog` file.
